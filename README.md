# ark_broadcast
broadcast ark signed tx
a very simple example on howto broadcast an already signed tx on ARK network (thanks for his precious help to fixcrypt and to gr33ndrag0n for his working ark node)

```
> sudo apt-get install nodejs
> sudo apt-get install npm

> git clone https://github.com/corsaro1/ark_broadcast
> cd ark_broadcast/

> npm install
```

## mainnet (example 1, using curl):
```
> var=$(node arktx.js)


> curl -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "version: 0.8.0" -H "port: 1" -H 'nethash: 6e84d08bd299ed97c212c886c98a57e36545c8f5d645ca7eeae63a8bd62d8988' -X POST -d '{"transactions":['$var']}' https://api.arknode.net/peer/transactions/
```

##Â mainnet (example 2, using "request"):
```
> node arktx2.js AbEtS8VA4LA1wgJWf4wA3JKyZrfvimp4Ht 1 "passphrase" "secondpass"
```
